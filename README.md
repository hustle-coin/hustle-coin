<h3>Hustle Coin Git Hub</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hustle Coin was developed out of the necessity to provide 
investors a genuine token to invest and grow with. The 
creators of HSTL are investors like you, who are tired of 
the hundreds of scam coins hitting the market.</p>

<p>We asked ourselves many times, why Hustle Coin? And we answered it by coming up with a unique lottery 
system in which anyone can win simply by holding HSTL coin. There are no numbers that you need to purchase, 
no visiting ad-loaded websites, or anything else that can potentially lead to a compromised system. Simply hold 
Hustle Coin and you might be the one saying hello to the moon.
Introducing the Hustle Coin Moon Wallet.
The Hustle Coin Moon Wallet will be funded each month with 5% of the Marketing wallet's balance. From each 
HSTL transaction, 7% goes directly to the Moon Wallet then on the 25th of each month, Hustle Coin automatically 
selects one(1) HSTL wallet holding at least 100 HSTL coins or more and awards them 100% of the Moon Wallets 
balance. Best of all, the winning wallet is paid out in BNB.</p>


<p><b>tokenomics</b></p>

Hustle Coin will launch with a total supply of 500,000,000,000 (500Billion) HSTL and will burn 
tokens at a rate of ~10% each month until a total of 50% of all HSTL tokens have been burned. 
Each transaction will carry a 15% transaction tax broken down to the following:
